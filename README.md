# wizardcoder-vsc 
a Visual Studio Code extension, developed as a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate how AI-powered code auto-completion features like GitHub Copilot work.


## To understand how WizardCoder works, you can refer to the main files:

- `extension.ts`: This file contains the code for registering the command and the status bar item for activating the extension.
- `WizardCoderInlineCompletionItemProvider.ts`: This file includes the code for fetching the WizardCoder api backend for code completion suggestions and providing them to the Visual Studio Code.
